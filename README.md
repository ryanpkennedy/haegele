## Basic TODOs
* [x] Setup continuous integration/build of infrastructure with Cloudformation
* [ ] Setup CI/CD of application
* [ ] Create React frontend (with hooks)
* [ ] Serve app with Node.js/Express running through an NGINX proxy
* [ ] Build all game logic with Node (might use webhooks?)
* [ ] Figure out the right DB to use
